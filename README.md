# -Analog-to-Digital-Converter-Interfacing-with-FPGA
This project connects the ADC0809 analog-to-digital converter to an FPGA using Verilog. It captures analog input signals, converts them into digital data, and processes the information on the FPGA. This setup is ideal for incorporating sensors and real-world analog signals into digital systems.
